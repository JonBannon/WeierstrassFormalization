# The Weierstrass-type product construction

Scaffolding for the proof of Theorem `prop:Zi` (`GaussianRealization.lean`), following the
paper's proof (`integer_weierstrass_18.tex`, Section 3) closely: given an effective divisor
`D` on `𝔻`, we build a holomorphic function on `𝔻` with zero divisor `D` and Taylor
coefficients in `ℤ[i]`, as an infinite product
`f(z) = ∏' k, E k (c k) (z / a k)`
where `a` enumerates the (locally finite) support of `D` with multiplicity, the degree of the
`k`-th factor is simply `k` (dense, no gaps — this is the key simplification making both the
Gaussian-integer forcing *and* the convergence estimate work with a single index), and the
correction constants `c : ℕ → ℂ` are chosen via `exists_c_taylorCoeff_mul_E_succ_eq` (Remark
`rem:triangular`, `AffineControl.lean`) to round each newly-introduced Taylor coefficient of
the partial products to the nearest Gaussian integer. The point of rounding to the *nearest*
Gaussian integer (rather than forcing the coefficient to `0`) is the bound
`‖c k - 1‖ ≤ (√2/2) * (k+1) * ‖a k‖ ^ (k+1)`: the `‖a k‖ ^ (k+1)` growth here exactly cancels
the `‖a k‖ ^ (k+1)` shrinkage of `‖z / a k‖ ^ (k+1)` in the convergence estimate, giving a
bound independent of how fast `a k` approaches the boundary.

This file is organized as a sequence of lemmas mirroring the paper's proof structure. Several
are stated but not yet proved (`sorry`); each docstring records exactly what it must establish
and how it is meant to be used, so they can be tackled independently.

/-- **Bound on the exponent `G_n(w;c)`** (Section 3, Step 3, first display).
For `‖w‖ ≤ ρ < 1`,
`‖G n c w‖ ≤ ‖c - 1‖ / (n+1) * ρ^(n+1) + ρ^(n+2) / (1 - ρ)`,
bounding the affine-correction term and the geometric tail of the exponent separately.

Proof sketch: bound the first term of `G` by the triangle inequality directly. For the tail
`∑' k, if k ≥ n+2 then w^k/k else 0`, bound `‖w^k/k‖ ≤ ‖w‖^k` termwise (since `k ≥ n+2 ≥ 1`)
and sum the resulting geometric tail `∑_{k ≥ n+2} ρ^k = ρ^(n+2)/(1-ρ)`, reusing the
shift/reindexing argument from `E_eq_exp_G`'s proof (`Function.Injective.hasSum_iff` with

/-! ## Divisor enumeration -/

/-- **Divisor enumeration** (Section 3, proof of `prop:Zi`, first paragraph).
The support of an effective divisor `D`, away from the origin, can be enumerated as a
sequence `a : ℕ → ℂ` realizing the multiplicity function `D.mult` by counting repeats
(`Set.ncard` of the fibre), with the enumerated points escaping to the boundary of `𝔻` in the
sense that any fixed radius `s < 1` bounds `‖a k‖` from below for all but finitely many `k`.

Unlike the paper, we do not require `a k ∈ 𝔻`: to handle a divisor with finite support
uniformly (rather than as a separate "vacuous" case — see the discussion in
`GaussianRealization.lean` on the gap this closes in the paper's treatment of that case), the
enumeration is padded, once the support is exhausted, by a fixed point outside `𝔻` (e.g.
`a k := 2`), which trivially satisfies the escape property and contributes no zero in `𝔻`.
The point `z = 0` is excluded here and handled separately in the final assembly by an
explicit monomial factor `z ^ D.mult 0`.

Proof sketch: `𝔻 \ {0}` is exhausted by the compact annuli `{z | 1/(m+2) ≤ ‖z‖ ≤ 1-1/(m+2)}`;
on each, `D.finite_inter_compact` gives a finite subset of the support with multiplicities,
listed (each point repeated according to its multiplicity) into a finite list; concatenating
these lists over `m`, in order, gives an enumeration of `D.support \ {0}` with the escape
property (paper's "such an enumeration exists ... because `S` is discrete"). If this
enumeration is finite (or empty), continue it with the constant sequence `a k := 2`. -/

/-! ## The partial products and the inductive rounding step -/

/-- The `N`-th partial product `P_N = ∏_{k<N} E_k(z/a_k; c_k)` (paper's `P_N`, `0`-indexed so
that `partialProduct a c 0 = 1` and the `k`-th factor introduced has degree exactly `k`). -/

  fun z => ∏ k ∈ Finset.range N, E k (c k) (z / a k)

theorem partialProduct_zero (a c : ℕ → ℂ) : partialProduct a c 0 = fun _ => 1 := by
  funext z; simp [partialProduct]

theorem partialProduct_succ (a c : ℕ → ℂ) (N : ℕ) :
    partialProduct a c (N + 1) = fun z => partialProduct a c N z * E N (c N) (z / a N) := by
  funext z; simp [partialProduct, Finset.prod_range_succ]

/-- **Inductive coefficient forcing** (Section 3, proof of `prop:Zi`, Step 1's Claim).
Given points `a : ℕ → ℂ` with `a k ≠ 0`, there is a sequence of correction constants
`c : ℕ → ℂ` such that, writing `P N := partialProduct a c N`:
* every Taylor coefficient of `P N` at degree `N` is (the image of) a Gaussian integer
  (this is the coefficient exactly forced at stage `N`, by rounding to the nearest element
  of `ℤ[i]`; degrees `< N` were already forced, and stay unchanged, at earlier stages by
  `taylorCoeff_mul_E_eq_of_le`);
* the rounding error is controlled: `‖c k - 1‖ ≤ (√2/2) * (k+1) * ‖a k‖ ^ (k+1)`.

Proof sketch: induction on `N`, using `exists_c_taylorCoeff_mul_E_succ_eq` at each step with
`h := P N`, target `:= (nearestGaussianInt (taylorCoeff (P N) (N+1)) : ℂ)`, to choose `c N`
forcing `taylorCoeff (P (N+1)) (N+1) = (nearestGaussianInt (taylorCoeff (P N) (N+1)) : ℂ)`;
then read off the bound on `‖c N - 1‖` from the affine formula in `taylorCoeff_mul_E_succ`
combined with `norm_sub_nearestGaussianInt_le`. The induction also needs, at each step,
`AnalyticAt ℂ (P N) 0` and `P N 0 = 1`, both immediate from `E_zero`/`analyticAt_auxQ`-style
facts about finite products of `E`. -/

/-! ## The Weierstrass `M`-test -/

/-- **Weierstrass convergence estimate** (Section 3, proof of `prop:Zi`, Step 3).
Given the quantitative rounding bound on `c` from `exists_coeffSeq` and the escape property
from `exists_enum_of_effectiveDivisor`, the factors `E k (c k) (· / a k)` satisfy a
Weierstrass `M`-test on every compact `K ⊆ 𝔻`: there is a summable bound, uniform in `z ∈ K`.

Proof sketch: fix `K ⊆ 𝔻` compact, so `K ⊆ {z | ‖z‖ ≤ r}` for some `r < 1`
(`IsCompact.exists_forall_le`/boundedness), and fix `s` with `r < s < 1`. By the escape
property, `‖a k‖ ≥ s` for all but finitely many `k`; for those `k` and `z ∈ K`,
`‖z / a k‖ ≤ r / s < 1`, so `norm_G_le` applies (with `ρ := r/s`), and the hypothesis on `c k`
makes the affine term collapse to `(√2/2) r^(k+1)` exactly as in the paper (the `‖a k‖^(k+1)`
factors cancel). Both resulting terms are summable in `k` (geometric with ratios `r < 1` and
`r/s < 1`), and their sum eventually is `< 1/2`, so `E_eq_exp_G` together with
`Complex.norm_exp_sub_one_le` (`‖exp x - 1‖ ≤ 2‖x‖` for `‖x‖ ≤ 1`) converts the `G`-bound into
a bound on `‖E k (c k) (z/a k) - 1‖`. The finitely many exceptional small `k` are handled by
enlarging the bound `u` on a finite set (summability of a sequence is unaffected by changing
finitely many terms). -/

/-! ## The zero divisor of the product -/

/-- **Zero-divisor identification** (Section 3, proof of `prop:Zi`, Step 4).
At every point `z ∈ 𝔻`, the order of vanishing of the infinite product equals the sum of the
orders of vanishing of the (finitely many, by local finiteness of the enumeration) factors
vanishing there — which, since each `E (n k) (c k) (· / a k)` has a simple zero exactly at
`z = a k` (`E_zero_iff`), equals the number of `k` with `a k = z`.

Proof sketch: split the product at an index `K` beyond which no factor vanishes at `z` (finite
by the escape property applied to `s := ‖z‖ < 1`, or directly since `{k | a k = z}` is finite —
this needs a finiteness fact packaged alongside `exists_enum_of_effectiveDivisor`, e.g. via the
escape property with `s` slightly above `‖z‖`). The initial finite product has order exactly
`{k | a k = z}.ncard` (additivity of `analyticOrderNatAt` under finite products,
`analyticOrderAt_mul`/`analyticOrderNatAt_mul`, plus `E_zero_iff`); the tail product, by the
same `M`-test and `tprod_one_add_ne_zero_of_summable`-style non-vanishing criterion used in
`holomorphicOn_tprod_factors`, is holomorphic and non-vanishing near `z`, contributing order
`0`. -/

/-! ## Passing Taylor coefficients to the limit -/

/-- **Stabilization of Taylor coefficients** (Section 3, proof of `prop:Zi`, Step 2).
For each fixed degree `m`, once `n k > m` the `m`-th Taylor coefficient of the infinite
product agrees with that of the `(k+1)`-st partial product — hence, combined with
`exists_coeffSeq`'s Gaussian-integer forcing and `taylorCoeff_mul_E_eq_of_le`, every Taylor
coefficient of the limit lies in `ℤ[i]`.

Proof sketch: write the infinite product as the `(k+1)`-st partial product times the tail
`∏' j ≥ k+1, E (n j) (c j) (·/a j)`; by `taylorCoeff_mul_E_eq_of_le` applied with `n := n k`
(needs `m ≤ n k`) it suffices that the tail is analytic at `0` with value `1` there — the
value-`1` part holds since every tail factor is `1` at `0` (`E_zero`) and the tail converges
locally uniformly (by the same `M`-test argument, reindexed), and analyticity follows as in
`holomorphicOn_tprod_factors`. -/
